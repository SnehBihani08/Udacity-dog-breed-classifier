Questions regarding Uploaded Image Classification:

1. Did the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: ResNet classified Dog_01.jpg as a Labrador Retriever.
AlexNet classified Dog_01.jpg as a German Shepherd.
VGG classified Dog_01.jpg as a Golden Retriever.
Therefore, there are differences in the breed classifications.


2. Did each of the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed of dog as that model architecture classified Dog_02.jpg? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: ResNet classified Dog_01.jpg as a Labrador Retriever and Dog_02.jpg as a Labrador Retriever as well.
AlexNet classified Dog_01.jpg as a German Shepherd and Dog_02.jpg as a German Shepherd.
VGG classified Dog_01.jpg as a Golden Retriever and Dog_02.jpg as a Golden Retriever as well.
Hence, each model classified both Dog_01.jpg and Dog_02.jpg as the same breed.


3. Did the three model architectures correctly classify Animal_Name_01.jpg and Object_Name_01.jpg to not be dogs? If not, report the misclassifications.

Answer: ResNet misclassified Animal_Name_01.jpg as a dog.
AlexNet correctly classified both Animal_Name_01.jpg and Object_Name_01.jpg as not dogs.
VGG misclassified Object_Name_01.jpg as a dog.
The misclassifications occurred with ResNet and VGG.


4. Based upon your answers for questions 1. - 3. above, select the model architecture that you feel did the best at classifying the four uploaded images. Describe why you selected that model architecture as the best on uploaded image classification.

Answer:   VGG seems to be the best model architecture. It achieved 100% accuracy in classifying "dogs" and "not-a-dog" images and had the highest accuracy (93.3%) in breed classification among the three architectures. This indicates that VGG is more reliable in identifying both the presence of dogs and their breeds compared to the other architectures.
